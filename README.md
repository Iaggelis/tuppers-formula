# Tupper's self-referential formula

A simple visualization of tupper's self-referential formula using C and SDL2. The code for the visualization is a simplified version of Tsoding's nice project  [https://github.com/tsoding/gp](https://github.com/tsoding/gp). The calculation part is not yet 100% correct, as can be seen from the screenshot:
